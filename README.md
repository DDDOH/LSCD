## Timeline

The tasks are listed in order

| Task                                                         | Approximated time needed                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Finalize the C version Run through queue code                | 1 day                                                        |
| Link the C version Run through queue code to python          | 1 day                                                        |
| Implement NoisyReinforcedMLP                                 | 2 days                                                       |
| Check the old generator penalty code                         | 0.5 day                                                      |
| Compare the performance of (MLP + Geoless) (NoisyReinforcedMLP + Geoless) | Writing the code is fast, but thereâ€™s a lot of uncertainty in the performance of these model. |
|                                                              |                                                              |
